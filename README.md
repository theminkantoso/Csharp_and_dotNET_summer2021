# Csharp_and_dotNET_summer2021
I started Learning Csharp and ASP.NET Core in 2021 Summer. This repository is my progress. While FrontEnd is included, the majority goes to BackEnd
1. WebApplication3: (FreeCodeCamp)
  - .NET, MVC and Entity Framework
  - A little bit of DDD
  - SQL Server and .NET via Connection String
  - Pipeline and Middleware (understanding Startup.cs)
  - Blazor FE
2. WebApplication4: (FreeCodeCamp)
  - Consolidating my knowledge from WebApplication3
  - More about controller mapping, routing
  - DB access
  - Blazor FE and table orginazation
  - add-migration and database-update
3. WebApplication5: (Udemy)
  - WebApp5Api
    + Postman
    + More about API and routing, testing API and validation
    + Action Filter
    + Resource Filter
    + Model Binding
    + Model Validation, Validation Attribute
  - Core: Refactoring
    + Message now can be broadcasted from any channel
    + Reduce dependency of validation from MVC 
  - EF.DataStore: Framework Entity
    + However foreign key constrain has yet to be applied, considering using SQL Server or create validation filter later
    Now it is only a build-in memory version, no SQL Server Included
4. WebApplication6: (Udemy, **THE BIGGEST PROJECT IN THIS REPORTORY**)
  - More about Dependency Injection
  - Repository Pattern
  - Entity Framework
